###Caveat emptor###

&lsquo;*Caveat emptor*&rsquo; is a Latin phrase, usually translatied as: &ldquo;Let the buyer beware.&rdquo;  In law it is taken to mean:

>the principle that a person who buys something is responsible for making sure that it is in good condition, works properly, etc. &ndash; [Merriam-Webster online dictionary](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/caveat%20emptor)

What it means for this repository is: I am not a programmer, or a professional system administrator, etcetcetc.  The scripts and such in this repository work for me.  Or, more exactly, they worked for me when I added them to the repository.  They may or may not work for you.  I offer them in a good faith effort to be helpful, but you need to verify everything yourownself.
